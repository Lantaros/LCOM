The mouse has 2 counters that keep track of movement:
	X movement counter
	Y movement counter
	
These counters are 9-bit complement values and each has an overflow flag
They are sent in the form of a 3-byte data packet

These omvement counters represent the mouse's offset relative to its position
when the previous movement data packet was issued OR when the last "Non-Resend" (0xFE)
command was seccessfully sent to the host

Mouse reads input -> records the current state of its buttons
				  -> increments/decrements the movement counters according to the amount
				     of movement that has occurred since the last input sample
				  -> if a counter overflows, the appropriate overflow flag is set
				  -> further modification of the counter is disabled until the counters are reset
				  
RESOLUTION -> determines the amount by which the movement counters are incremented/decremented
		      (default: 4 counts/mm)
	Resolution value changed with "Set Resolution" (0xE8) command
	
SCALLING -> affects the reported value of the counters
            (default: 1:1 scalling - no effect on the reported mouse movement)
     Scalling value changed with the "Set Scalling" (0xE7) command
     
SAMPLE RATE -> maximum rate at which movement data may be reported.
			   (default: 100 samples/sec)
			   sample rate ranges from 10 to 200 samples/sec
	  Sample Rate value changed with the "Set Sample Rate" (0xF3) command   
     
     
     
     
MOVEMENT DATA PACKET

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
	   |  Bit 7     | Bit 6      | Bit 5      | Bit 4      | Bit 3    | Bit 2      | Bit 1     | Bit 0     |
Byte 1 | Y overflow | X overflow | Y sign Bit | X sign Bit | Always 1 | Middle Btn | Right Btn | Left Btn  |
Byte 2 |					X movement																	   |
Byte 3 |					Y Movement															           |

Movement values range from -255 to +255. If the range is exceeded, the appropriate overflow bit is set.




MODES OF OPERATION


Reset - initial mode in which the mouse performs initialization and self-diagnostics
      - sample rate = 100 samples/sec
      - resolution = 4 counts/mm
      - scalling = 1:1
      - data reporting = disabled
      
Stream - default operating mode in which the mouse issues movement data packets when movement occurs or button state changes
	   - data reporting - disabled (by default) -> MUST BE ENABLED WITH 0xF4 COMMAND
	   - default operating mode
	   
Remote - the host must poll for movement data packets
	   - mouse reads inputs and updates its counter flags at the current sample rate
	   - does not automatically issue data packets when movements has occured
	   - to do that, "Read Data" (0xEB) command is issued
	   - when 0xEB is issued, mouse sends a single movement data packet and resets its movement counters
	   - enabled with the 0xF0 command
	   
Wrap - A purely diagnostic mode where the mouse echoes every received packet back to the host
	 - Every byte received by the mouse is sent back to the host
	 - only the "Reset" (0xFF) and "Reset Wrap Mode" (0xEC) commands aren't echoed
